# EA-for-Feature-Selection

## Overview and rationale
An agent has a reinforcment-learning task (e.g. get upwards on the gradient) and evolvable structure of its 'nervous system'.

The agent has several input neurons (e.g. neuron that detects change in concentration (derivative)) but during the course of evolution it may get more of them (may be of different kind, e.g. change in change (second derivative)). By this problem of Feature Selection will presumably be solved.

Beyond FS questions of interest are:

1. How will biologically-plausible changes in input neurons affect deeper layers of the network? (e.g receptor dublication)
2. What properties of network make it more or less evolvable in terms of acquiring new input modalities?

The concept is also described here:https://www.reddit.com/r/compmathneuro/comments/um2y17/question_in_field_of_neuroevolution/
